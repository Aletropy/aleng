# How to build?

## Arch

1. Install the required dependencies

    ```yay -S cmake gcc ninja glfw```

2. Clone the repository

    ```git clone https://github.com/Aletropy/aleng```

3. Build and run the project

    ```
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -G Ninja ..
    ninja
    ```

## Other Distributions
I'll not provide a step-by-step in how to build this in every distro. But you can look for cmake and ninja building and you're fine.
